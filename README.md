**Types of Wireframes**

- Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
- High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.
